# Finding customer similarity by using Distance Matrix & Try to predict Term Deposit results of customers via Neural Networks

The dataset I used is publicly available and can be found in this UCI Machine Learning Repository webpage; [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  I used "bank-additional-full.csv" dataset for this project. However, I used Google Colaboratory platform instead of my own CPU. 

This dataset was created by Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho) and SÃ©rgio Moro (ISCTE-IUL) at 2012 and subjected to paper published as " S. Moro, R. Laureano and P. Cortez. Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology." The paper also can be found in this [link](http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/14838)
